                    <p>The Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary is renowned for its role in the conservation of migratory birds, serving as a crucial stopover site for thousands of avian species during their annual migration along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Each year, from September to April, millions of birds from as far as Siberia, China, and Japan flock to the sanctuary to rest, feed, and refuel before continuing their journey southward. The sanctuary provides a safe haven for these birds, offering abundant food sources, shelter, and protection from predators, allowing them to replenish their energy reserves and complete their long-distance migration.</p>
